SIMILARITY THRESHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Recommended Threshold: 0.6
Reason: acceptable graph density (90.63%) - fully connected graph

Analysis:
- Graph density: 90.63%
- Average degree: 3088.7
- Number of edges: 5,264,664
- Connected components: 1

Guidelines:
- Good threshold: 0.3-0.5 (balanced connectivity)
- Too low (<0.3): Dense graph, many weak connections
- Too high (>0.6): Sparse graph, disconnected components

Alternative thresholds:
  - 0.5: Denser graph (99.55% density, 3392.7 avg degree)
  - 0.7: Sparser graph (41.07% density, 1399.8 avg degree)
